# EcoSort# ♻️ EcoSort: Smart Waste Classifier

**EcoSort** is a Computer Vision application designed to automate waste sorting. It uses Machine Learning to classify items as either **Recyclable** or **Organic/Trash** in real-time, helping users reduce contamination in recycling bins.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-time Classification:** Instantly detects waste type via webcam or image upload.
* **Classical ML Approach:** Built using **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** and **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** for feature extraction.
* **Lightweight:** Deployed on Streamlit for low-latency inference.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **ML Engine:** Scikit-Learn (SVM), Scikit-Image (HOG)
* **Interface:** Streamlit
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, NumPy
